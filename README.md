circBDCNN: distinguishing circular RNAs from other long non-coding RNAs with Broad Dilation Convolutional Neural Network

circBDCNN is a computational tool for distinguishing circRNAs from other lncRNAs. By ingeniously combining the Broad Learning System (BLS) and Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (Dilated-CNN), circBDCNN built a Broad Dilation Convolutional Neural Network (BDCNN) to learn the multiscale contextual information from raw transcript sequence and corresponding antisense strand sequence, and further integrated the high level abstraction representation of conservation information to distinguish circRNAs from other lncRNAs.circBDCNN shows a superior performance than other existing methods for distinguishing the circRNAs from other lncRNAs.
